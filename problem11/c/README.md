# C Solution for Matrix Product Problem

This folder contains the C implementation for finding the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in a matrix. Includes:

- `matrix_product.c`: Main solution code.
- `test_matrix_product.c`: Unit tests for the core logic.
- `matrix.txt`: Input matrix (copied from the root/problem11 folder).

## Build & Run

To build and run:

```sh
make test   # Build and run tests
make run    # Run the main solution (requires matrix.txt)
```
