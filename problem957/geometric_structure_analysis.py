GEOMETRIC STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

All formulas fail because they produce non-integers beyond n=5.
This suggests the process has deeper structure than simple recurrence.

Let's analyze the GEOMETRY:
1. Point multiplicities (lines through each point)
2. Collinearity patterns
3. Symmetries and invariants
4. Projective structure

Sequence: [2, 8, 28, 184, 1644, 19068]
