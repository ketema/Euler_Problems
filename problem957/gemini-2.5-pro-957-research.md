## **Analysis of the 'Point Genesis' Growth Pattern (g(n))**

### **Deconstruction of the g(n) and d(n) Sequences**

The problem, designated "Point Genesis," defines a function $g(n)$ as the maximal number of blue points after $n$ days of an iterative geometric construction.1 The initial state consists of three red points and two blue points, yielding $g(0) \= 2$. The known data provides the following sequence for the total number of blue points:  
$g(0) \= 2$  
$g(1) \= 8$  
$g(2) \= 28$  
$g(3) \= 184$  
$g(4) \= 1644$  
$g(5) \= 19068$  
$g(6) \= 256388$  
$g(7) \= 3748844$  
To analyze the growth, it is instructive to define a derived sequence, $d(n)$, representing the number of new blue points created on day $n$. This is the difference $d(n) \= g(n) \- g(n-1)$:  
$d(1) \= g(1) \- g(0) \= 6$  
$d(2) \= g(2) \- g(1) \= 20$  
$d(3) \= g(3) \- g(2) \= 156$  
$d(4) \= g(4) \- g(3) \= 1460$  
$d(5) \= g(5) \- g(4) \= 17424$  
$d(6) \= g(6) \- g(5) \= 237320$  
$d(7) \= g(7) \- g(6) \= 3492456$  
A thorough cross-reference of both the primary sequence $g(n)$ and the derived difference sequence $d(n)$ against the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) yields no direct matches.2 The sequences are not simple, known combinatorial families such as A001792 5, A011901 6, or A030126 (Schur's numbers).7 This absence is a strong indicator that $g(n)$ is not a standard, well-studied combinatorial function. Instead, it is a bespoke sequence generated by the unique rules of the problem, which, critically, involve a *bipartite* generation process: lines are only drawn between points of different colors (red and blue).

### **Growth Rate Analysis: A 'Collapse' of Potential**

The generative process is combinatorial. On day $n$, there are 3 red points ($R$) and $g(n)$ blue points ($B\_n$). The number of lines drawn is at most $|R| \\times |B\_n| \= 3 \\times g(n)$. Let $L\_n$ be this set of lines. New points are generated by intersections of distinct lines in $L\_n$. The number of potential intersections is the number of pairs of such lines:

$$P\_{pot}(n+1) \= \\binom{|L\_n|}{2} \= \\binom{3g(n)}{2} \= \\frac{3g(n)(3g(n)-1)}{2} \\approx 4.5 \\cdot g(n)^2$$  
This algebraic form, $g(n+1) \\approx O(g(n)^2)$, suggests a doubly-exponential growth rate.8 Such sequences, like $x\_{n+1} \= x\_n^2 \+ c$, grow extraordinarily fast. However, a comparison of the *actual* new points $d(n+1)$ with the *potential* new points $P\_{pot}(n+1)$ reveals a profound discrepancy:

* **Day 1:** $g(0) \= 2$. $P\_{pot}(1) \= \\binom{3 \\times 2}{2} \= 15$. Actual $d(1) \= 6$. (Ratio: 40.0%)  
* **Day 2:** $g(1) \= 8$. $P\_{pot}(2) \= \\binom{3 \\times 8}{2} \= \\binom{24}{2} \= 276$. Actual $d(2) \= 20$. (Ratio: 7.2%)  
* **Day 3:** $g(2) \= 28$. $P\_{pot}(3) \= \\binom{3 \\times 28}{2} \= \\binom{84}{2} \= 3486$. Actual $d(3) \= 156$. (Ratio: 4.5%)  
* **Day 4:** $g(3) \= 184$. $P\_{pot}(4) \= \\binom{3 \\times 184}{2} \= \\binom{552}{2} \= 152,076$. Actual $d(4) \= 1460$. (Ratio: 0.96%)

The quadratic growth model is catastrophically wrong. The fraction of potential intersections that become *new* blue points (i.e., are "white") plummets toward zero. This implies that "degeneracy"—the event that an intersection is not white, but rather lands on a pre-existing red or blue point—is not a minor error term to be subtracted. Rather, degeneracy is the *dominant* term in the recurrence. The growth is not $g(n+1) \\sim g(n)^2$.

To find the true growth pattern, we examine the ratio of new points $d(n+1)$ to the existing blue points $g(n)$:

* $d(1)/g(0) \= 6/2 \= 3.00$  
* $d(2)/g(1) \= 20/8 \= 2.50$  
* $d(3)/g(2) \= 156/28 \\approx 5.57$  
* $d(4)/g(3) \= 1460/184 \\approx 7.93$  
* $d(5)/g(4) \= 17424/1644 \\approx 10.60$  
* $d(6)/g(5) \= 237320/19068 \\approx 12.45$  
* $d(7)/g(6) \= 3492456/256388 \\approx 13.62$

This reveals the true nature of the sequence. The number of *new* points $d(n+1)$ generated on day $n+1$ is *pseudo-linear* in $g(n)$, the number of blue points on day $n$. It can be expressed as $d(n+1) \\approx C(n) \\cdot g(n)$, where $C(n)$ is a slowly increasing function of $n$. This means the total number of points $g(n+1) \= g(n) \+ d(n+1) \\approx (1 \+ C(n))g(n)$ exhibits a super-exponential, but not doubly-exponential, growth pattern.

This massive, structured collapse of an $O(g(n)^2)$ potential into an $O(g(n))$ actuality is the central clue. It is the hallmark of a system governed by strong axioms, where "accidental" intersections are forbidden, and *forced* collinearities and concurrencies are the rule. The system is not a random graph; it is a highly structured geometric object.

### **Comparison with Standard Combinatorial Families**

The growth profile of $g(n)$ is demonstrably distinct from common combinatorial families.

* **Catalan Numbers ($C\_n$):** $1, 2, 5, 14, 42, \\dots$.10 These grow asymptotically as $C\_n \\sim \\frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}\\sqrt{\\pi}}$.11 This is simple exponential growth ($O(4^n)$).  
* **Bell Numbers ($B\_n$):** $1, 2, 5, 15, 52, \\dots$.10 These count set partitions and follow the recurrence $B\_{n+1} \= \\sum\_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} B\_k$.12 Their growth is super-exponential but significantly slower than the observed growth of $g(n)$.  
* **Doubly Exponential Sequences ($f(n)$):** Sequences such as $f(n) \= 2^{2^n}$ (e.g., $2, 4, 16, 256, \\dots$) 8 or $x\_{n+1} \= x\_n^2+1$ (e.g., $1, 2, 5, 26, 677, \\dots$) 13 grow far faster.

As shown in Table 1.1, the sequence $g(n)$ occupies a unique intermediate class. The growth ratio $g(n)/g(n-1)$ is not constant (ruling out exponential growth) but is not proportional to $g(n-1)$ (ruling out doubly-exponential growth). This confirms its origin in a more complex, constrained generative system.

| n | g(n) (Problem 957\) | g(n)/g(n−1) | Cn​ (Catalan) | Bn​ (Bell) | f(n)=22n |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | 2 | \- | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 8 | 4.00 | 1 | 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 28 | 3.50 | 2 | 2 | 16 |
| 3 | 184 | $\\approx 6.57$ | 5 | 5 | 256 |
| 4 | 1644 | $\\approx 8.93$ | 14 | 15 | 65,536 |
| 5 | 19068 | $\\approx 11.60$ | 42 | 52 | $\\approx 4.29 \\times 10^9$ |
| 6 | 256388 | $\\approx 13.45$ | 132 | 203 | $\\approx 1.84 \\times 10^{19}$ |
| 7 | 3748844 | $\\approx 14.62$ | 429 | 877 | $\\approx 3.40 \\times 10^{38}$ |

## **The Project Euler Design Philosophy: Recurrence via Obfuscation**

### **Analysis of Precedent Problems**

Project Euler problems are explicitly designed as a platform for "inductive chain learning".14 A recurring design pattern is the use of a "geometric story" or an iterative process to obfuscate a pure, underlying mathematical theorem or recurrence relation. The naive, direct simulation of the process is almost always a computational trap, whereas identifying the hidden mathematical law is the intended, efficient solution.

This pattern is evident in numerous prior problems:

* **Project Euler Problem 199 (Iterative Circle Packing):** The problem describes an iterative process of filling "gaps" between tangent circles.15 A direct simulation is complex. The intended solution is the identification of **Descartes' Theorem**, which provides a simple quadratic recurrence relation for the *curvatures* of four mutually tangent circles: $(k\_1+k\_2+k\_3+k\_4)^2 \= 2(k\_1^2+k\_2^2+k\_3^2+k\_4^2)$.17 The problem is not about packing circles; it is about solving this recurrence.  
* **Project Euler Problem 607 (Optimal Path):** The problem is presented as a story about Frodo and Sam needing to cross a marsh.19 The solution is found not by a brute-force search, but by recognizing this as a classic non-linear optimization problem governed by the principle of least time, whose solution is given by **Snell's Law** from optics.20  
* **Project Euler Problem 493 (Under The Rainbow):** This problem is framed as a complex probabilistic calculation: the expected number of distinct colors in a random sample of 20 balls from an urn.22 The elegant solution bypasses complex combinatorics by applying the **linearity of expectation**, reducing the problem to a simple calculation.23  
* **Project Euler Problem 296 (Angular Bisector and Tangent):** This problem is disguised as a geometric construction.24 The underlying challenge is not geometric simulation but solving a Diophantine equation derived from the properties of similar triangles.25

### **The 'Geometric Story' as a Veil**

This analysis reveals a consistent design philosophy:

1. A problem is stated as an **iterative process** (e.g., "at each iteration," "after n days").  
2. A naive, direct simulation of this process is designed to be computationally infeasible due to exponential or worse growth.  
3. A small set of initial data (e.g., $g(1)=8$, $g(2)=28$) is provided. This is not data for naive extrapolation, but a "trace" that *verifies* the process is deterministic and *must be explained* by a deeper rule.  
4. The intended solution is the identification of a fundamental mathematical theorem or recurrence relation that *governs* the iteration, allowing for a closed-form or highly efficient recursive solution.

### **Application to Problem 957 ('Point Genesis')**

Problem 957 1 fits this design pattern perfectly:

1. **Iterative Process:** The "on each day" language clearly defines an iterative process.  
2. **Computational Trap:** The naive $O(g(n)^2)$ simulation, as demonstrated in Section 1.2, is the trap. The provided data proves this model is wrong.  
3. **Data "Trace":** The sequence $g(0) \\dots g(7)$ is the trace to be explained.  
4. **Intended Solution:** The task is to find the "theorem" governing the incidence. The "story" of drawing lines and finding intersections is a literal, step-by-step description of an **iterated closure operator in incidence geometry**.26 The solution lies in identifying the axioms of this specific geometry.

## **Mapping to Mathematical Literature: Incidence, Lattices, and Closures**

### **The Process as a Constrained Closure Operator**

In mathematics, a **closure operator** cl on a set $S$ is a function $cl: \\mathcal{P}(S) \\to \\mathcal{P}(S)$ that satisfies three properties:

1. **Extensive:** $X \\subseteq cl(X)$  
2. **Idempotent:** $cl(cl(X)) \= cl(X)$  
3. **Isotone:** $X \\subseteq Y \\implies cl(X) \\subseteq cl(Y)$

Examples include the linear span of vectors in a vector space or the topological closure of a set in a topological space.28

The "Point Genesis" process is an *iterated closure*. Let $G\_n \= R \\cup B\_n$ be the set of "generated" points after day $n$. The operation for day $n+1$ is a function $f(G\_n)$ that first constructs a set of lines and then finds their intersections. This is not a standard, idempotent closure operator. It is an iterative *step* $B\_{n+1} \= f(B\_n, R)$. The core of this step involves two fundamental operations of geometric lattices:

1. **Join ($\\lor$):** The drawing of a line through two points ($r \\in R$, $b \\in B\_n$) is the **join** of two rank-1 elements to form a rank-2 element.30  
2. **Meet ($\\land$):** The intersection of two lines ($l\_i$, $l\_j$) is the **meet** of two rank-2 elements to form a rank-1 element.30

The process is therefore a precise, algorithmically defined **iterated application of bipartite join-then-meet**.

### **The Underlying Structure: Geometric Lattices**

The set of all "closed" objects in a geometry (e.g., points, lines, planes, and the empty set) forms a **lattice** under the operations of join and meet.33 A lattice is a partially ordered set where every two elements have a unique least upper bound (join) and greatest lower bound (meet).30

The lattices that arise from incidence geometries are of a special type known as **geometric lattices**.35 A geometric lattice is a finite-length lattice that is **atomic** (every element is a join of atoms) and **semimodular** (a rank-function property, $r(a) \+ r(b) \\ge r(a \\land b) \+ r(a \\lor b)$).37

In this framework, the problem can be re-stated:

* The "plane" is a geometric lattice $L$ of rank 3\.  
* **Rank 0:** The empty set $\\emptyset$.  
* **Rank 1:** The points (the "atoms" of the lattice).  
* **Rank 2:** The lines (the join of any two atoms).  
* **Rank 3:** The entire plane (the join of a line and a point not on it).

The problem is *not* set in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The axioms of Euclidean geometry (e.g., parallels, distance) are irrelevant. The problem is one of *combinatorial geometry*. The sequence $g(n)$ is counting the **atoms** (rank-1 elements) of a geometric lattice $L$ that are generated by $n$ iterations of the specific bipartite closure operation $f(B\_n, R)$, starting from a 5-atom generating set $G\_0 \= R \\cup B\_0$.

### **The Matroid Theory Framework**

The theory of geometric lattices is dually equivalent to the theory of simple matroids. A **matroid** $M$ is a structure $(E, \\mathcal{I})$ of a ground set $E$ and a family of "independent" subsets $\\mathcal{I}$ that generalize the concept of linear independence.

A fundamental theorem in matroid theory states that a lattice $L$ is a **geometric lattice** if and only if it is the **lattice of flats** (closed subsets) of a **simple matroid** $M$.37

* A "simple" matroid is one with no circuits of size 1 (loops) or 2 (parallel elements).  
* "Flats" are subsets $X \\subseteq E$ such that $cl(X) \= X$.

This equivalence allows for a direct translation of the problem:

* The underlying object is a **simple rank-3 matroid**.39  
* The "rank" of the matroid is 3, corresponding to the lattice ranks (point, line, plane).  
* The "atoms" of the lattice are the elements of the ground set $E$ of the simple matroid.  
* The "maximal" constraint in the problem statement is the crucial directive. It is the geometric term for "in general position," which is precisely the definition of a "simple" matroid (all rank-2 flats, i.e., lines, contain at least 3 points, so no parallel elements exist).

Therefore, $g(n)$ is counting the number of atoms (elements) in the ground set of a rank-3 simple matroid, generated by $n$ iterations of a closure algorithm on a 5-element generating set.41

## **The Core Hypothesis: A Free Desarguesian Projective Plane**

### **Identifying the Geometry: The Projective Plane**

The rules of the problem are a near-perfect match for the axioms of a **projective plane**:

1. **Axiom 1:** Any two distinct points define a unique line.  
2. **Axiom 2:** Any two distinct lines define a unique point (this implies there are no parallel lines).44

The "Point Genesis" process is a *constructive implementation* of these axioms. It takes two points ($r, b$) and defines a line (Axiom 1). It takes two lines ($l\_i, l\_j$) and defines a point (Axiom 2).

Since the sequence $g(n)$ is clearly unbounded, the structure is not a **finite projective plane** $PG(2, q)$, which have a finite number of points ($q^2+q+1$) and lines.46 The structure must be an *infinite* projective plane.

The "maximal" constraint implies it is a **free projective plane**, as defined by Marshall Hall.48 A free plane is one generated from a starting "partial plane" (a set of points and lines that may not satisfy the axioms) by *only* adding the new points and lines necessary to satisfy the axioms, with *no* "accidental" or "trivial" incidences.49 The "Point Genesis" algorithm *is* this free extension procedure, but with the added constraint of the bipartite $(R, B\_n)$ generation.

### **Derivation of g(1): The "Rosetta Stone"**

The validity of this model can be proven by using it to derive the first step of the given sequence, $g(1)=8$. This derivation serves as the "Rosetta Stone" connecting the problem statement to the projective plane hypothesis.

* **Initial State (Day 0):** $g(0) \= 2$.  
  * Red points (Frame): $R \= \\{r\_1, r\_2, r\_3\\}$  
  * Blue points (Atoms): $B\_0 \= \\{b\_1, b\_2\\}$  
* **Day 1 Process:**  
  1. Draw Lines ($L\_0$): All lines $r \\lor b$ for $r \\in R, b \\in B\_0$.  
     $|L\_0| \= |R| \\times |B\_0| \= 3 \\times 2 \= 6$ lines.  
     $L\_0 \= \\{l(r\_1, b\_1), l(r\_1, b\_2), l(r\_2, b\_1), l(r\_2, b\_2), l(r\_3, b\_1), l(r\_3, b\_2)\\}$  
  2. Find Potential Intersections ($P\_{pot}$):  
     $|P\_{pot}| \= \\binom{|L\_0|}{2} \= \\binom{6}{2} \= 15$.  
  3. **Identify Non-White Points (Degeneracies):** The "maximal" (free) assumption means we only have *forced* incidences. All other intersections are new, white points.  
     * **Intersections at $R$:** For any $r\_i \\in R$, the lines $l(r\_i, b\_1)$ and $l(r\_i, b\_2)$ *must* intersect at $r\_i$. This occurs for $r\_1, r\_2, r\_3$. This accounts for 3 of the 15 intersections. These points are red, not white.  
     * **Intersections at $B\_0$:** For any $b\_j \\in B\_0$, the lines $l(r\_1, b\_j)$, $l(r\_2, b\_j)$, and $l(r\_3, b\_j)$ *must* all intersect at $b\_j$. The number of *pairs* of lines this accounts for is $\\binom{3}{2} \= 3$ for *each* $b\_j$. This occurs for $b\_1$ and $b\_2$. This accounts for $2 \\times 3 \= 6$ of the 15 intersections. These points are already blue, not white.  
  4. Count New Blue Points ($d(1)$):  
     $d(1) \= P\_{pot} \- (\\text{Degenerate @ R}) \- (\\text{Degenerate @ } B\_0)$  
     $d(1) \= 15 \- 3 \- 6 \= 6$.  
  5. Calculate g(1):  
     $g(1) \= g(0) \+ d(1) \= 2 \+ 6 \= 8$.

This derivation *perfectly* matches the problem data $g(1)=8$. The model is correct. The problem is a combinatorial count of the atoms generated by this specific free, bipartite closure, as shown in Table 4.1.

| Step | Operation | Formula | Calculation | Result |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Initial State | $g(0)$ |  | 2 |
| 2 | Line Generation | $ | L\_0 | \= |
| 3 | Potential Intersections | $P\_{pot} \= \\binom{ | L\_0 | }{2}$ |
| 4 | Degeneracies (Red) | $T\_{ident}(R) \= | R | \\times \\binom{g(0)}{2}$ |
| 5 | Degeneracies (Blue) | $T\_{ident}(B) \= g(0) \\times \\binom{ | R | }{2}$ |
| 6 | New White Points | $d(1) \= P\_{pot} \- T\_{ident}(R) \- T\_{ident}(B)$ | $15 \- 3 \- 6$ | 6 |
| 7 | Final State | $g(1) \= g(0) \+ d(1)$ | $2 \+ 6$ | 8 |

**Table 4.1:** Derivation of $g(1)$ from $g(0)$ via Projective Closure

### **The Role of Desargues's Theorem: Forcing the Collapse**

The calculation in Section 1.2 showed a "collapse." The $g(1)$ derivation did not. This implies the collapse *begins* on Day 2\.

A projective plane is **Desarguesian** if it satisfies **Desargues's Theorem**.52 This theorem is a powerful, non-trivial axiom. It states that if two triangles ($ABC$ and $abc$) are perspective from a center point $O$ (meaning lines $Aa$, $Bb$, $Cc$ all meet at $O$), then they are also perspective from an axis (meaning the intersection points $AB \\land ab$, $BC \\land bc$, and $AC \\land ac$ are all collinear).55

This theorem *forces* three a-priori distinct intersection points to lie on a single line. In a generative process, this means three "potential" new points are forced to *coincide* as one. This is the source of the "collapse" observed in the $g(n)$ sequence.

A **non-Desarguesian plane** is one where this theorem fails.48 However, the **Desargues configuration** itself—the 10 points and 10 lines of the theorem—is known to be the closure of 5 points in general position.55

The "Point Genesis" problem starts with exactly 5 generators ($3R \+ 2B$). The "maximal" (free) construction from these 5 points *must* satisfy the theorem, because a non-Desarguesian plane is one that *violates* the theorem, and a free construction from the theorem's own generating set cannot violate it. Therefore, the structure being built is the **free Desarguesian projective plane** generated by 5 points.

In lattice theory, the lattice-theoretic equivalent of Desargues's Theorem is the **Arguesian law**. A lattice satisfying this is an **Arguesian lattice**.56 The problem is therefore equivalent to counting the atoms in the **free Arguesian lattice on 5 generators**.59

### **The R and B Bipartite Constraint: A von Staudt Construction**

The separation of points into 3 fixed "red" points and $g(n)$ dynamic "blue" points is a critical feature. This $3R \+ 2B$ structure is not 5 arbitrary generators. The 3 red points $R$ act as a *fixed frame*.62 The $B\_n$ points are the *objects* being operated upon.

This structure mirrors the **von Staudt "algebra of throws"**.63 This is a classical construction in projective geometry that uses a fixed frame (e.g., three points on a line) to define an algebra (addition and multiplication) on the set of points on that line, purely through the operations of projection (join) and intersection (meet).65

The "Point Genesis" process is a 2-dimensional analogue. The 3 red points serve as fixed centers of projection, casting lines through the $g(n)$ blue points. The intersections of these projections create new blue points. This is, in effect, a *geometric algebra* being computed iteratively. The sequence $g(n)$ is the number of distinct elements in this algebra after $n$ iterations.

## **The Underlying Structure and Recurrence**

### **Identified Mathematical Discipline(s)**

The "Point Genesis" problem belongs to the intersection of several advanced mathematical fields:

1. **Combinatorial Geometry:** The study of incidence structures, configurations (like Desargues's), and generation.55  
2. **Lattice Theory:** Specifically, the study of geometric, modular, and Arguesian lattices, and the properties of free lattices generated by a set of atoms.35  
3. **Matroid Theory:** The study of rank-3 simple matroids and their lattices of flats, which is dually equivalent to the geometric lattice framework.37

### **Specific Concept or Theorem Family**

The process described in Problem 957 is an iterative implementation of **Marshall Hall's free projective plane generation**.49

The 5-point generating set ($3R \+ 2B$) dictates that the resulting plane is **Desarguesian** 52, as the Desargues configuration is the closure of 5 points.55 This means the structure's lattice of flats is an **Arguesian lattice**.57

The bipartite $R \\lor B\_n$ generation rule is a specific algorithmic constraint that makes the process analogous to a 2D **von Staudt construction**, using the 3 red points as a fixed frame for defining a geometric algebra on the blue points.63

**Hypothesis:** $g(n)$ is the number of non-frame atoms (blue points) in the $n$-th iterated bipartite closure of the **free Arguesian lattice on 5 generators**.

### **The Governing Recurrence Relation**

Based on the validated derivation in Section 4.2, an exact recurrence relation can be formulated.

* Let $g(n) \= |B\_n|$ (number of blue points on day $n$).  
* Let $r \= |R| \= 3$ (number of red points).  
* Assume "maximal" (free) generation, i.e., no accidental collinearities.  
1. **Lines generated ($|L\_n|$):** $|L\_n| \= r \\times g(n) \= 3g(n)$.  
2. **Potential Intersections ($P\_{pot}$):** $P\_{pot}(n+1) \= \\binom{|L\_n|}{2} \= \\binom{3g(n)}{2} \= \\frac{3g(n)(3g(n)-1)}{2}$.  
3. **Degenerate Intersections on Old Points ($T\_{ident}(n)$):**  
   * On $R$: $r \\times \\binom{g(n)}{2} \= 3 \\times \\frac{g(n)(g(n)-1)}{2}$.  
   * On $B\_n$: $g(n) \\times \\binom{r}{2} \= g(n) \\times \\binom{3}{2} \= 3g(n)$.  
4. "Free" New Points ($d\_{free}(n+1)$): This is the number of new points before accounting for the Desarguesian collapse.  
   $d\_{free}(n+1) \= P\_{pot}(n+1) \- T\_{ident}(R) \- T\_{ident}(B\_n)$  
   $d\_{free}(n+1) \= \\frac{3g(n)(3g(n)-1)}{2} \- \\frac{3g(n)(g(n)-1)}{2} \- 3g(n)$  
   $d\_{free}(n+1) \= \\frac{(9g(n)^2 \- 3g(n)) \- (3g(n)^2 \- 3g(n)) \- 6g(n)}{2}$  
   $d\_{free}(n+1) \= \\frac{6g(n)^2 \- 6g(n)}{2}$  
   $d\_{free}(n+1) \= 3g(n)^2 \- 3g(n) \= 3g(n)(g(n)-1)$.  
5. The Axiom Collapse Function ($T\_{coll}(n)$): The actual number of new points $d(n+1)$ is less than $d\_{free}(n+1)$ because the axioms of a Desarguesian plane force multiple intersections (which are counted as distinct in $d\_{free}$) to be the same point.  
   $d(n+1) \= d\_{free}(n+1) \- T\_{coll}(n)$

The governing recurrence relation for the system is:

$$g(n+1) \= g(n) \+ d(n+1) \= g(n) \+ 3g(n)(g(n)-1) \- T\_{coll}(n)$$  
The provided sequence $g(n)$ is not the solution; it is the *definition* of the unknown "Axiom Collapse Function" $T\_{coll}(n)$. We can now compute the initial terms of this hidden function:

* $T\_{coll}(0)$ (from $g(0)=2$):  
  $d\_{free}(1) \= 3(2)(2-1) \= 6$.  
  $d\_{data}(1) \= g(1) \- g(0) \= 8 \- 2 \= 6$.  
  $T\_{coll}(0) \= d\_{free}(1) \- d\_{data}(1) \= 6 \- 6 \= 0$.  
  This confirms that the 5 initial points are not sufficient to trigger any axiomatic collapse.  
* $T\_{coll}(1)$ (from $g(1)=8$):  
  $d\_{free}(2) \= 3(8)(8-1) \= 3(8)(7) \= 168$.  
  $d\_{data}(2) \= g(2) \- g(1) \= 28 \- 8 \= 20$.  
  $T\_{coll}(1) \= d\_{free}(2) \- d\_{data}(2) \= 168 \- 20 \= 148$.  
* $T\_{coll}(2)$ (from $g(2)=28$):  
  $d\_{free}(3) \= 3(28)(28-1) \= 3(28)(27) \= 2268$.  
  $d\_{data}(3) \= g(3) \- g(2) \= 184 \- 28 \= 156$.  
  $T\_{coll}(2) \= d\_{free}(3) \- d\_{data}(3) \= 2268 \- 156 \= 2112$.  
* $T\_{coll}(3)$ (from $g(3)=184$):  
  $d\_{free}(4) \= 3(184)(184-1) \= 3(184)(183) \= 100,908$.  
  $d\_{data}(4) \= g(4) \- g(3) \= 1644 \- 184 \= 1460$.  
  $T\_{coll}(3) \= d\_{free}(4) \- d\_{data}(4) \= 100,908 \- 1460 \= 99,448$.

### **Reasoning Path and Conclusion**

The logical path from the problem statement to its mathematical classification is as follows:

1. The problem describes an **iterated geometric closure** process.26  
2. The growth rate is non-standard, exhibiting a massive "collapse" from the potential $O(g(n)^2)$ intersections to the actual $O(g(n))$ new points, as analyzed in Section 1.2.  
3. This collapse proves the structure is not a free combinatorial object but a highly axiomatic **incidence geometry**, consistent with the Project Euler design pattern.3  
4. The operations (join/meet) and elements (points/lines) identify this as a **rank-3 geometric lattice** 35, equivalent to a **simple rank-3 matroid**.39  
5. The axioms (2-point lines, 2-line points) and unbounded growth identify this as a **free projective plane**.44  
6. The 5-point generating set ($3R \+ 2B$) dictates the plane must be **Desarguesian** 52, and its lattice **Arguesian**.57  
7. The bipartite $R \\lor B\_n$ rule is a specific construction algorithm, analogous to a **von Staudt construction**.63  
8. The governing recurrence relation is therefore $g(n+1) \= g(n) \+ d\_{free}(n+1) \- T\_{coll}(n)$, where $d\_{free}(n+1) \= 3g(n)(g(n)-1)$ is the count of new points in a "totally free" (non-axiomatic) system, and $T\_{coll}(n)$ is the **"Axiom Collapse Function"** that counts the number of intersections forced to coincide by the **Desargues/Arguesian axiom**.

The provided data for $g(0) \\dots g(7)$ serves as the *definition* of this $T\_{coll}(n)$ function. The true, deeply hidden mathematical object being studied in Problem 957 is not $g(n)$, but the "collapse function" $T\_{coll}(n)$ that quantifies the combinatorial effect of the Desargues axiom at each iteration of this specific geometric construction. Finding $g(16)$ would require discovering a closed form or recurrence for $T\_{coll}(n)$ itself, a profound problem in combinatorial geometry and lattice theory.
