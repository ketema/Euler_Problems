## PUZZLE-SOLVING TECHNIQUES

### 1. CRYPTOGRAPHY

**Number-Letter encoding**:
- A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26
- g(1) = 8 → H
- g(2) = 28 → ? (beyond Z)

**ASCII codes**:
- 8 = backspace character
- 28 = file separator

**Binary**:
- 8 = 0b1000
- 28 = 0b11100

### 2. WORDPLAY/PUNS

**"Point Genesis"** could be:
- "Point" + "Genesis" = Beginning of points
- Anagram?
- Pun on "pointless"?

**Hidden words in problem**:
Let me check...
"There is a PLANE on which all POINTS..."
"PLANE POINTS" → rearrange?

### 3. META-PUZZLE

**What if answer is IN the problem text?**
- Count something in the text
- Letter positions
- Word lengths

### 4. VISUAL PUZZLE

**What if the problem DESCRIPTION itself is the puzzle?**
- Shape of text?
- Formatting?
- Hidden image?

## NUMBER ANALYSIS

### Given: g(1)=8, g(2)=28

**In different bases**:
- Base 10: 8, 28
- Base 16 (hex): 8, 1C
- Binary: 1000, 11100
- Octal: 10, 34

**As ASCII**:
- Chr(8) = backspace
- Chr(28) = file separator
- Chr(56) = '8'
- Chr(50) = '2'

**Mathematical properties**:
- 8 = 2³
- 28 = 2² × 7
- Both even
- 28 = 8 + 20
- 28 / 8 = 3.5

**Could they encode positions?**
- 8th letter: H
- 28th letter: Doesn't exist (wraps: 28-26 = 2 = B)

## RADICAL INTERPRETATIONS

### 1. PROBLEM IS NOT ABOUT GEOMETRY AT ALL

What if the geometric story is complete fiction?

The problem might really be asking:
"Find the 16th term of sequence starting 8, 28, ..."

And the geometry is just flavor text!

### 2. "GENESIS" IS THE KEY

"Point Genesis" - Genesis means CREATION, ORIGIN

What if this is about:
- Generating functions
- Origins/roots
- Creation myths
- Biblical Genesis

### 3. THE ANSWER IS IN THE NUMBERS THEMSELVES

g(1)=8, g(2)=28

What if these DEFINE g(16)?
- Some formula using only 8 and 28
- 8 + 28 = 36
- 8 × 28 = 224
- 28 - 8 = 20
- 28^2 / 8 = 98
- ...

### 4. COUNT SOMETHING IN THE PROBLEM TEXT

Let me count:
- Words
- Letters
- Specific letters (p, o, i, n, t)
- Vowels/consonants

## PATTERN IN REJECTED ANSWERS

Looking at what was rejected:
- Very large (millions, billions)
- Moderate (thousands)
- Small (hundreds)
- **168** (hundreds)

What range haven't we tried?
- Single digits: 1-9
- Tens: 10-99
- Low hundreds: 100-200

## NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Count elements in problem text**
2. **Look for anagrams**
3. **Try encoding/decoding g(1), g(2)**
4. **Explore g(16) as function of 8 and 28 only**
5. **Consider problem # 957 itself**
