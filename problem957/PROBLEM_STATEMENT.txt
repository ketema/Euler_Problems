PROBLEM 957: POINT GENESIS
==========================

There is a plane on which all points are initially white, except three red points and two blue points.

On each day, every line passing through a red point and a blue point is constructed. Then every white point, where two different such lines meet, turns blue.

Let g(n) be the maximal possible number of blue points after n days.

For example, g(1) = 8 and g(2) = 28.

Find g(16).

KEY FACTS:
- Initial: 3 red points (fixed), 2 blue points
- Each day: Draw lines through (red, blue) pairs
- Intersections of different lines turn blue
- g(1) = 8 means 6 new blues on day 1 (2 initial + 6 new = 8 total)
- g(2) = 28 means 20 new blues on day 2 (8 + 20 = 28 total)
- Find: g(16)
