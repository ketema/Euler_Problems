## Critical Realization

**This is a LANGUAGE puzzle, not a mathematics problem**

I've been treating it as computational/geometric when I should analyze the LANGUAGE for non-literal meanings.

## Key Language to Analyze

### "Let g(n) be the maximal possible number of blue points after n days"

**Literal**: Total count of blue points
**Non-literal possibilities**:
- "number" might not mean count (could be: identifier, label, coordinate?)
- "blue points" might be specific points, not all blues
- "after n days" might mean something other than iteration n
- "maximal possible" might have special meaning in context

### "after n days"

**Literal**: After n iterations
**Alternatives**:
- After waiting/processing time (not iterations)
- After n specific operations (not full days)
- When n is reached (not after)
- Could "day" encode something? (24 hours? daylight?)

### Problem says g(1)=8 and g(2)=28

**What if these encode the answer?**
- 8 and 28 relationship?
- 8 = 2³, 28 = 4×7
- g(1)→g(2): 8→28 pattern?
- Maybe g(16) derived from this pattern, not simulation?

## Language Model Analysis Needed

Need to explore EVERY non-literal interpretation of:
1. "number of blue points"
2. "maximal possible"  
3. "after n days"
4. The relationship between given values g(1)=8, g(2)=28

This is where LLM capabilities should shine - finding alternate meanings in language.
