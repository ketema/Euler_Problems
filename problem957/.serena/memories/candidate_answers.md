**User directive:** "Do deep research, not just in math, but in puzzle solving. Language, synonyms, dual meanings."

## What We Haven't Fully Explored

### Language/Wordplay
- Exact meaning of EVERY word
- Synonyms for "point", "line", "plane", "day", "blue", "red"
- Homonyms and puns
- Anagrams
- Hidden words or acronyms

### Puzzle Techniques
- Cryptography/encoding
- Visual puzzles (what if it's about the IMAGE?)
- Meta-puzzles (answer encoded in problem structure)
- Lateral thinking puzzles
- Trick questions

### Non-Literal Interpretations
- "Point" = decimal point? Bullet point? Compass point?
- "Line" = queue? Text line? Telephone line?
- "Plane" = airplane? Flat surface? Woodworking tool?
- "Day" = 24 hours? Daylight? D.A.Y. acronym?
- "Red" and "Blue" = political? Temperature? Wavelength?

### Numbers as Encoding
- g(1)=8, g(2)=28 might ENCODE the answer
- 8 and 28 in different bases?
- ASCII codes?
- Positions in alphabet?

## Next Steps: DEEP DIVE
1. Analyze every word for alternate meanings
2. Research puzzle-solving techniques
3. Look for hidden patterns in problem TEXT itself
4. Consider meta-puzzle interpretations
5. Explore cryptographic/encoding possibilities
