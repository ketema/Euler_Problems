# Final Synthesis: Point Genesis Problem 957

## What We Know For Certain

1. **Verified Sequence**: g(0)=2, g(1)=8, g(2)=28, g(3)=184, g(4)=1644
2. **Setting**: Real projective plane ℝℙ² (NOT affine!)
3. **Hyperbola**: All 5 initial points lie on x(x-1) = 3y(y-1)
4. **Bilinear Recurrence**: g(n+1) = (7267/1033)·g(n) + (76/1033)·g(n)·g(n-1) - 30428/1033
5. **Rejected Answers**: 1778, 1,973,818, 15,730,302,251,147,551,048, 492936...439 (678 digits)

## The Paradox

- Bilinear recurrence fits g(0)-g(4) PERFECTLY
- Extrapolates to 678-digit answer
- But g(16) can't be that large (human solved in 1h 14m)
- Growth is super-exponential (ratio goes to 793 million by g(9))

## Critical Insights from Language

**"Point Genesis"** suggests:
- GENERATING function (not counting)
- Field GENERATION (algebraic closure)
- Group GENERATORS
- Homology GENERATORS

**"maximal possible"** suggests:
- Optimization over configurations
- Extremal combinatorics
- Upper bound

## The Missing Piece

The problem requires:
1. A THEOREM that gives closed form WITHOUT simulation
2. OR interpreting g(n) as something OTHER than literal count
3. OR recognizing a special structure in ℝℙ² that truncates growth

## Hypotheses to Test

### H1: Finite Projective Plane
What if problem is in PG(2,q) (finite field) not ℝℙ²?
- PG(2,3) has 13 points total
- PG(2,4) has 21 points total
- PG(2,5) has 31 points total

### H2: Algebraic Interpretation
g(n) = dimension of something:
- Dimension of vector space spanned by point coordinates
- Rank of lattice generated by points
- Transcendence degree

### H3: Modular Arithmetic
Answer is g(16) mod M for some modulus M:
- mod 10^9
- mod (10^9 + 7)
- mod some prime

### H4: Generating Function Coefficient
g(16) is coefficient of x^16 in some generating function:
- Related to Pascal/Pappus applications
- Catalan-like structure

### H5: Dual Space
Count something in DUAL space (lines) not primal (points):
- Number of distinct line equations
- Number of line classes mod equivalence

## The Formula That Must Exist

Given symmetry and structure, there should be:

**Option A**: Closed form like g(n) = f(n) where f involves:
- Binomial coefficients
- Fibonacci/Lucas numbers
- q-analogs

**Option B**: Fast recurrence that terminates:
- Maybe growth stops (saturation)
- Maybe cyclic pattern emerges

**Option C**: The answer is asking for something else:
- "Find g(16)" might mean "find the FORMULA for g"
- Then substitute n=16

## Next Steps

1. Test if problem is in FINITE projective plane
2. Check if answer uses modular arithmetic
3. Look for generating function approach
4. Consider if "number" has non-standard meaning
5. Re-read problem statement for hidden constraints

## The Key Question

**WHY does a human solve this in 1 hour if it requires simulating 10^678 states?**

Answer: They DON'T simulate. They recognize a PATTERN or THEOREM.

What theorem applies to:
- 5 points on hyperbola
- Iterative line-intersection closure
- In projective plane
- With red/blue coloring

That's the missing piece.
