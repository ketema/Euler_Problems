# TASK: Solve Project Euler Problems #29 and #30

## Task ID
task-gemini-001

## Orchestrator
claude-orchestrator (Claude Code instance)

## Agent
gemini

## Requirements
Solve Project Euler problems #29 and #30 with FULL CONSTITUTIONAL ADHERENCE.

### Problem #29: Distinct Powers
Consider all integer combinations of a^b for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100.
How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by a^b?

### Problem #30: Digit Fifth Powers
Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
(Note: 1 = 1^5 does not count as it is not a sum)

## Constitutional Requirements (MANDATORY)

### CL6 TDD ENFORCEMENT
- RED → GREEN → COMMIT → REFACTOR cycle (MANDATORY)
- Tests MUST be written FIRST
- Tests MUST describe behavior, not trivial checks
- Evidence: Test files, test output, commits

### Evidence Format (MANDATORY)
Use canonical compressed format:
```
F:path/to/file.py:10-50
T:module::test_name=PASS
C:commit_hash
COV:X%
O:"output snippet"
```

### Response Template (MANDATORY)
```
STATE: <current workflow state>
BRANCH: <git branch>
TOKEN_BUDGET: <current>/<total> (<percent>%) - <remaining> remaining
NEXT MACRO: <next deterministic macro>

ACTIONS:
1. ...

EVIDENCE:
...

BLOCKERS: <missing info or none>
```

### Completion Gates (CL2)
- All tests pass
- Coverage >85%
- Evidence logged
- Serena MEMORY updated
- Git commits with WHY/EXPECTED format

## Constraints
1. Activate Serena project: `Euler_Problems`
2. Follow M1→M2→M3→M4→M5 macros
3. Use Serena think tools at checkpoints
4. Store solutions in appropriate files
5. Provide correct numerical answers

## Deliverables
1. Solutions to both problems (#29, #30)
2. Test files with passing tests
3. Git commits with proper format
4. Evidence of constitutional compliance
5. Write response to: `.serena/memories/task-gemini-001-response.md`

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Correctness**: Are the numerical answers correct?
2. **Constitutional Compliance Score**: Rules followed / Total applicable rules × 100%
   - CL1-CL9 (9 laws)
   - QS1-QS6 (6 standards)
   - M1-M5 (5 macros with mandatory checkpoints)
   - Evidence format compliance
   - Response template compliance

## Notification Protocol
When complete, send completion prompt to orchestrator:
```bash
tmux send-keys -t claude-orchestrator.0 "TASK COMPLETE: task-gemini-001. Problems #29, #30 solved. Read: task-gemini-001-response.md"
tmux send-keys -t claude-orchestrator.0 C-m
```

## Start Command
Activate Serena project first:
```
/serena activate Euler_Problems
```

Then begin with M1 ORIENT YOURSELF.
