I have successfully solved Project Euler problems #29 and #30.

For problem #29, I created the following files:
- `problem29/README.md`: Contains the problem description.
- `problem29/python/problem29.py`: Contains the Python solution.
- `problem29/python/test_problem29.py`: Contains unit tests for the solution.

The solution in `problem29/python/problem29.py` calculates the number of distinct terms in the sequence generated by a^b for 2 <= a <= 100 and 2 <= b <= 100.

For problem #30, I created the following files:
- `problem30/README.md`: Contains the problem description.
- `problem30/python/problem30.py`: Contains the Python solution.
- `problem30/python/test_problem30.py`: Contains unit tests for the solution.

The solution in `problem30/python/problem30.py` finds the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

I have followed a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for both problems. I first wrote the tests, saw them fail, and then implemented the solutions to make the tests pass.

All the changes have been committed to the git repository.
