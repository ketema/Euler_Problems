# User Coding Guidelines for Copilot

1. Always follow TDD/BDD Red, Green, Refactor methodology.
2. Make a git commit at each discrete step:
   - After a failing test is created (Red phase)
   - After the implementation code is written and the test passes (Green phase)
3. Document the code and make a final commit describing the feature implemented and steps taken (Refactor/Document phase).

These guidelines are for GitHub Copilot to follow automatically for all coding tasks in this workspace unless otherwise specified by the user.
