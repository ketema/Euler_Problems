## Code Comprehension Analysis

### Readability Score (1-10, 10 = most readable)

| Language | Score | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Python   | 9/10  | Natural language-like syntax, minimal boilerplate |
| Rust     | 7/10  | Clear but verbose, type annotations help |
| Perl     | 6/10  | Traditional OOP, some Perl-specific idioms |

### Key Readability Factors

**Python Advantages**:
```python
def solve_problem13(input_text: str) -> str:
    numbers = [int(line.strip()) for line in input_text.strip().split('\n')]
    return str(sum(numbers))[:10]
```

**Rust Advantages**:
- Strong type system prevents errors
- Explicit error handling with `Result` types
- Memory safety guarantees

**Perl Advantages**:
- Comprehensive POD documentation
- Object-oriented design
- Mature ecosystem
